Philadelphia has played an extensive role in United States history. 
The city was founded in 1682 by William Penn, an English Quaker and advocate of religious freedom. 
The city served as the capital of the Pennsylvania Colony during the British colonial era and went on to play a historic and vital role as the central meeting place for the nation's founding fathers during the American Revolution and subsequent Revolutionary War. 
Philadelphia hosted the First Continental Congress in 1774, preserved the Liberty Bell, and hosted the Second Continental Congress during which the nation's 56 founders formed the Continental Army and elected George Washington as its commander in 1775, and unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. For nine months, from September 1777 to June 1778, the city fell under British occupation during the war's Philadelphia campaign. 
In 1787, the U.S. Constitution was ratified in Philadelphia at the Philadelphia Convention. 
Philadelphia remained the nation's largest city until 1790, and it served as the nation's first capital from May 10, 1775, until December 12, 1776, and on four subsequent occasions until 1800, when construction of the new national capital in Washington, D.C. was completed.
Philadelphia maintains extensive contemporary influence in business and industry, culture, sports, and music.

The University of Pennsylvania (commonly referenced as Penn[note 3] or UPenn) is a private Ivy League research university in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. 
It is one of nine colonial colleges and was chartered prior to the U.S. Declaration of Independence when Benjamin Franklin, the university's founder and first president, advocated for an educational institution that trained leaders in academia, commerce, and public service. 
Penn identifies as the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this representation is challenged by other universities since Franklin first convened the board of trustees in 1749, arguably making it the fifth-oldest.
The university has four undergraduate schools and 12 graduate and professional schools. 
Schools enrolling undergraduates include the College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the Wharton School, and the School of Nursing. 
Among its graduate schools are its law school, whose first professor James Wilson participated in writing the first draft of the U.S. Constitution, its medical school, which was the first medical school established in North America, and the Wharton School, the nation's first collegiate business school.
Penn's endowment is $21 billion, making it the sixth-wealthiest private academic institution in the nation as of 2023. 
In 2021, it ranked fourth among U.S. universities in research expenditures, according to the National Science Foundation. 
The University of Pennsylvania's main campus is located in the University City neighborhood of West Philadelphia, and is centered around College Hall. 
Notable campus landmarks include Houston Hall, the first modern student union, and Franklin Field, the nation's first dual-level college football stadium and the nation's longest-standing NCAA Division I college football stadium in continuous operation. 
The university's athletics program, the Penn Quakers, fields varsity teams in 33 sports as a member of NCAA Division I's Ivy League conference.
Penn alumni, trustees, and faculty include eight Founding Fathers of the United States who signed the Declaration of Independence, seven who signed the United States Constitution, 24 members of the Continental Congress, three presidents of the United States, 38 Nobel laureates, nine foreign heads of state, three United States Supreme Court justices, at least four Supreme Court justices of foreign nations, 32 U.S. senators, 163 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, 19 U.S. Cabinet Secretaries, 46 governors, 28 State Supreme Court justices, 36 living undergraduate billionaires (the largest number of any U.S. college or university), and five Medal of Honor recipients.
