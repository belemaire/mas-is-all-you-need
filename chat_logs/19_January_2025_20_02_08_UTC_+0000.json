It is a private Ivy League research university that was chartered before the U.S. Declaration of Independence, with its board of trustees first convened in 1749. This makes it one of the oldest institutions of higher education in the United States, often identified as the fourth-oldest, although this is sometimes debated (its historical founding date is around 1779) (source: University of Pennsylvania Overview, last updated on 19 January 2025).\n\nIn comparison, the University of California, Berkeley, was founded in 1868 (source: University of California, Berkeley Overview, last updated on 19 January 2025). Therefore, the University of Pennsylvania was established significantly earlier than UC Berkeley. \n\nIf you have any further questions or need more information, feel free to ask! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udcda",

Winter is punctuated with rainstorms of varying ferocity and duration, but also produces stretches of bright sunny days and clear cold nights.

The summers are cooler than a typical Mediterranean climate thanks to upwelling ocean currents along the California coast. These help produce cool and foggy nights and mornings. Winter is punctuated with rainstorms of varying ferocity and duration, but also produces stretches of bright sunny days and clear cold nights. It does not normally snow, though occasionally the hilltops get a dusting. Spring and fall are transitional and intermediate, with some rainfall and variable temperature.
